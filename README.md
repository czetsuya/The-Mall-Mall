--The Mall Mall (Mall experience x2)--
---On the Spot Deal Finder Mobile Application---

My group The Mall Mall
is developing a deal finder mobile application
to help regular shoppers on the mall
find the most interesting deals on the spot
and use that deal right on.


It will work like a GPS system with 2 components: a mini-satellite and a GPS receiver (can be any blue-tooth mobile device). The signal will be constrained on a small place like a mall, but will produce more accurate position.
